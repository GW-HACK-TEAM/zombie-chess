# Zombie Chess 
## Submitted for the Github GameOff 2016

[zombie-chess.com](zombie-chess.com)

Using:
[Stockfish.js](https://stockfishchess.org)
[Chessboard.js](http://chessboardjs.com/)


The core idea was that we could take an existing game (chess) and put our own unique, fun and engaging spin on it. As it happened, Github was running a month-long hack, the Github Game Jam with very loose guidelines around hacking, modding or augmenting.
Unlike last year, where we were building Petricide completely from scratch, we decided this time we'd remove some of the blockers we'd encountered in an effort to deliver something more exciting and more complete by the end of the 12 hour period.

The beauty with Zombie Chess is that it isn't a brand new concept, which means there were some great foundations to get the ball rolling. We decided to use Stockfish.js to power the AI and Chessboard.js as the basis for the UI wrapper and game events, so we had a system that we know worked - meaning we could bypass the bones and get straight to the meat of the project. With these solid foundations we could make a great single-player game experience, putting the player against a chess AI.
